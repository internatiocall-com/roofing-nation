UNDERLAYMENT: This is a really important layer on tile roofs since it is a second barrier against water intrusion and elements, it works as a shield and patch on top of the base sheet and it provides a warranty against leaks.<br>

A roof tile is made to last up to 50 years exposed to elements before needing a replacement. the installation of this roof system will depend on three main factors: <br>2) Homeowner Budget <br>3) Roof structure conditions (engineering apply) <br>4) Allowed roof system by the HOA if the homeowner lives in a gated community previous requirements are mandatory to have cleared before moving forward with a roofing contractor.                  </div>

FIRE BARRIER: This layer is highly important in this type of roofs as it represents a layer of safety and insulation between the metal panels and the roof deck, remember that an average house in the state of Florida is exposed to at least 11 hours of sunlight, this barrier serves to minimize fire hazards.<br>
METAL PANELS: This is the top and visible layer of a metal roof, there are different manufacturers, styles, colors and thicknesses of panels throughout the state of Florida, we work directly with certified suppliers and the valid documentation of these panels. <br></div>
